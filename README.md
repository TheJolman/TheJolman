## Hi, I'm Josh.
  
I'm a full time student, and a (mostly) solo software dev in my free time.  
Free and open source software enthusiest.
  
Things I'm currently learning:  
- `pandas`/`numpy`/`lets_plot` for Data Science
- Sveltekit and webdev in general  
- Nix for packaging software and creating declarative environments
- A little bit of Unity for helping with a game project
- leetcode grind ðŸ˜«    
  
I mainly develop with C++ (when I have time), and I love to spend way too much time  
trying to perfect my config (check out my `.dotfiles` repo if you're interested).  
  
**I'm always looking to collaborate on some project, especially if means learning something new.**
