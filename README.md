## Hi, I'm Josh.
  
I'm a full time student, and a (mostly) solo software dev in my free time.  
Free and open source software enthusiest.
  
Things I'm currently learning:  
- pandas/numpy/lets_plot/scikit-learn for Data Science
- Sveltekit for webdev  
- Nix for packaging software
- A little bit of Unity for a game project
- leetcode grind ðŸ˜«    
  
I mainly develop with C++ (when I have time), and I love to spend way too much time 
trying to perfect my config (check out my `.dotfiles` repo if you're interested).  
  
**I'm always looking to collaborate on some project, especially if means learning something new.**
