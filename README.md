## Hi, I'm Josh.
  
I'm a full time student, and a (mostly) solo software dev in my free time.  
Free and open source software enthusiast.
  
I mainly develop with C++ and Python (when I have time), and I love to spend way too much time 
trying to perfect my NixOS config (check out my [.dotfiles repo](https://github.com/thejolman/.dotfiles) if you're interested).  
  
**I'm always looking to collaborate on some project, especially if means learning something new.**
